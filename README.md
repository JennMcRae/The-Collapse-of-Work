The Collapse of Work in Canada: A Visual Breakdown
This project is a single-page web infographic that visualizes the breakdown of the Canadian workforce. 
It's based on an analysis by Jenn McRae, which argues that traditional employment represents a much smaller fraction of the population than commonly perceived.
The visualization follows a narrative funnel, starting with Canada's total population and progressively filtering it down to show the number of traditionally employed individuals. 
The goal is to make the data story clear, impactful, and easy to understand at a glance.

About the Project
This visualization was created to translate a data-driven blog post into an engaging and shareable web format. 
It uses a clean, modern design with custom brand colors to walk the user through several key statistics:
Total Population: 41.5MW
orking-Age Population: 27.0M
Labour Force Participants: 17.7M
Employed Population: 16.5M
"Traditionally" Employed: 7.5M
